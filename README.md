=====
Ruby wrapper around Microsoft's DPAPI

The DPAPI library uses the user's login password to encrypt arbitrary
plaintext, as well as decrypt the resulting ciphertext. There's a bit
more complexity there (AD integration, including support for password
changing), but that's about it. Unlike MacOS X Keychain, it doesn't
persist the ciphertext anywhere - that's the developer's
responsibility.

```
require "./lib/dpapi.rb"
include DpApi
secret = "i herd u liek cryptography"

ciphertext = DpApi.encrypt secret
ciphertext != secret or raise "OMG END OF EARTH"

plaintext, desc = DpApi.decrypt ciphertext
plaintext == secret or raise "OMG DOUBLE-END OF EARTH"
puts plaintext
```
